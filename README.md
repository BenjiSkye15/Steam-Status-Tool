# Steam-Status-Tool
allows you to customize your steam status

Uses "Add a Game > Add a Non-Steam Game..." and the "'Username' > V 'Online' / 'Away' / 'GAME'" to customize your steam status.

# How to Set it Up
1. Download the file "SST.exe".
2. In Steam, go to "LIBRARY" > "Add a game" > "Add a Non-Steam Game..." then click "Browse..." then find the file and click on it and then click open and then click "Add Selected Programs".
3. Rename it in Steam to the status you want by clicking "Manage" ![Manage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenjiSkye15/BenjiSkye15-Imgs/main/manage-steam.PNG) > "Properties" > "SST".

# How to Use
To use that status, you must open it in Steam.

You can close it from Steam, clicking the X, or pressing Enter (this works because i use the line "Console.ReadLine();" at the end).
